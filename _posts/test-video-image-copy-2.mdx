### The video I started from to make this blog

- I have developped my blog starting from this video for the logic.
- I have then updated all the dependencies to the latest version which makes some bugs to solve. That's why I even use a canary version of next*mdx*remote! But for security sake, I keep my posts inside my main repository.
- Enjoy the result reading some!
